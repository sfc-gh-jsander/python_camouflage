1. Install Python

2. Create a virtualenv with Python

3. Activate the virtualenv and install the dependecies listed in requirements.txt via pip

4. Open 2 terminal windows/tabs and activate the virtualenv in both of those sessions

5. CD into the decrypt directoy and in the first tab and adapt the Python code so it can authenticate to Snowflake (add username,password,accountURL)

6. Now you can launch the decrypt script. You will see that all the rows of the encrypted table will be shown to you decryted and a sum is calculated

7. Login to your Snowflake account in the webUI and check the history or run a history SQL and verify that the SQL issued by the script 
   only returned encrypted values within Snowflake

8.Change to the other terminal tab. DO NOT CLOSE OR EXIT the decrypt session tab. You will need it. 

9. CD into the encrypt directory

10. Again make sure the Python script has the information to be able to authenticate to your Snowflake account (username,password,accounturl)

11. Launch the Python script

12. The script will create a row in the encrypted table and prompt you for the values to enter into the colums. Please make sure you enter 
    strings for the string columns and integers for the integer columns.

13. One you have provided all the values the row is inserted into Snowflake encrypted. Meaning the scrupt encrypted the values before inserting them 
    into Snowflake. You will get a confirmation that his happened at the end of the script. 

14. Go back to your other terminal tab for the decryption script and run the decryption script again

15. You will see that your added row is there and the end with the values you provided

16. Go into the webUI in Snowflake and check with the FF3-Standard role how the table looks like. You will see that there are only encrypted values
    even the new ones you entered. 

17. Check the history in Snowflake for the insert SQL. You will see that only encrypted values were inserted.
